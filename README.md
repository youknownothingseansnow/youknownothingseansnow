Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a molecular and cell biologist with 8+ years of experience in therapeutic discovery, now focused on applying to PhD programs in computational biology. 

My passion is building the computational bridges that connect high-throughput experimental platforms with robust, scalable data. I have extensive hands-on experience in CRISPR gene editing (Cas9, AsCas12a, Base/Prime Editing) and functional genomics, and I've seen firsthand how critical workflow automation and data architecture are to research success. My goal is to leverage my deep bench experience to build these exact tools.


Key Skills & Interests

ðŸ§¬ Gene Editing: Deep expertise in CRISPR platforms, from high-throughput screening and guide RNA optimization to developing novel editors like AsCas12a Ultra.


ðŸ¤– Data & Automation: Passionate about workflow optimization. I have experience designing and building analytical pipelines to dramatically reduce data turnaround time (from weeks to days) and am proficient in Python and Benchling.

ðŸ”¬ Wet Lab Expertise: 8+ years in functional genomics, cell-based screening, and protein/nucleic acid analysis.

My Portfolio
I'm currently building a portfolio of projects that reflect my interest in data automation.

PlatePioneer: A Streamlit web app I built to solve a problem I faced in the lab: transforming raw 96-well plate data into a tidy, analysis-ready dataset. It features an interactive UI, data visualization, and a SQLite database backend.
